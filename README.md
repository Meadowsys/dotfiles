# dotfiles

what do u want from this repo?

for now, this is all just stuff to automatically run in a codespace, but it isn't working for some reason, so i provide this command thingie to run until i can get it to work for my codespaces:

```fish
git clone https://github.com/autumnblazey/dotfiles.git dotfiles && cd dotfiles && ./setup && cd .. && rm -rf dotfiles

```
